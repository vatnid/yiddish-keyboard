# Yiddish keyboard for macOS
This is a modified version of the Yiddish keyboard for macOS, originally designed by Isaac Bleaman.

This version contains both combining and precomposed versions of the characters, combining the Yiddish Klal and Yiddish Klal Ligatur keyboards made by Bleaman. 

## Installation
Copy both `Yiddish.keylayout` and `Yiddish.icns` (dark mode icon only) to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`.

## Typing
Refer to [this page](https://www.isaacbleaman.com/resources/yiddish_typing/) for detailed instructions.

### Differences with Yiddish Klal
This keyboard is mainly based on `Yiddish Klal`, with precomposed characters available at the same key positions when pressing the `⌥ option` key. 

Additionally, `Shift+D` and `Shift+G` is now `דּ` and `גּ` respectively.
